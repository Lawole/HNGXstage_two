Database Schema
The API uses an SQLite database named project.db to store user information. 
The database schema consists of a User table with two columns: id (primary key) and name (a string field).

## Usage
To interact with the API, you can use tools like curl, Postman, or write your own Python scripts. 
Here's a basic example using curl:

##### Create a user:
```curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John Micheal"}' https://hngstage-two.onrender.com/api```


##### Get all users:
```curl https://hngstage-two.onrender.com/api```


##### Update a user:
```curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Micheal"}' https://hngstage-two.onrender.com/api/1```

##### Delete a user:
```curl -X DELETE https://hngstage-two.onrender.com/api/1```
